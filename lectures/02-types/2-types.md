# Functional programming
Functional programming allows reasoning about programs and their subcomponents in the same way that you would reason about a mathematical expression.

We’re not just in the business of writing code, but correct code!

## Types

## Types guide structure (shape)
Functional programming places a great emphasis on types, which serve the purpose of documenting the purpose of code, and restricting the range of behaviors that a program is allowed to exhibit.

In this way, `types guide the structure of a program`, by providing clean interfaces for how different parts should interact, and what it should be allowed to do.
